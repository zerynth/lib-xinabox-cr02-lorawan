XinaBox CR02-LoRaWAN
*********************

The `CR02 xChip <https://wiki.xinabox.cc/CR02_-_LoRa_with_ATmega328P_Core>`_ forms part of the core radio modules and features an ATmega328P CPU running at 16 MHz for handling system and radio operations. The on-board RFM95W LoRaTM module provides ultra-long range spread spectrum communication and high interference immunity whilst minimizing current consumption.

CR02 is utilized as an I2C slave device using LoRaWAN to connect to `The Things Network <https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/>`_ over the 868MHz range.


Please note, CR02 and all other xChips is currently only supported in Zerynth Studio with `XinaBox CW02 <https://docs.zerynth.com/latest/official/board.zerynth.xinabox_esp32/docs/index.html>`_. Review the `Quick Start <https://wiki.xinabox.cc/Quick-Start>`_ guide for interfacing xChips.
